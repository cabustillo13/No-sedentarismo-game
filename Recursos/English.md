## Problematic

According to the World Health Organization, at least 60% of the world's population does not engage in the physical activity necessary to obtain health benefits. This is partly due to insufficient participation in physical activity during leisure time and an increase in sedentary behaviors during work and home activities.

Consequently, non-communicable diseases associated with physical inactivity are the biggest public health problem in most countries in the world.

The global evolution of physical activity is of particular concern in some high-risk populations: youth, women and older adults. It is important that, when developing and applying the "For your health, move" initiative.

## Solution

One way to get moving in a playful, fun and inexpensive way for children, adolescents and even older adults, is to integrate physical activities while playing video games. 

My project consists of an executable Python3 script that can be implemented simultaneously (in a parallel thread to be more specific) to computer games. Through a video capture system with the webcam, the script acquires the user's movements, processes them and translates them into keyboard commands (previously configured).

I had previously mentioned that it is a low cost tool. There's no need for the Wii console, no Xbox 360 kinect, or other expensive add-on to play with body motion. For our case, because the script works a certain range of colors. It is enough for the user to get some cardboard of the color corresponding to the configured color, paint with colors on a sheet, look for an element of the proposed color or change the color that the script is detecting to adapt it to the elements that he has at home. And with that is more than enough to be able to start playing your video games.

## Examples

I currently have a control to play the Chrome Dinosaur game, where the user sticks a piece of cardboard on the shirt, steps away from the camera, and runs the game. The user when jumping, the script interprets that action with the command of the space bar, and it will make the dinosaur jump in the game. When crouching, the script interprets that action with the key down command, and it will cause the dinosaur to crouch.

We also control the classic Snake game with our forehead. The user moves to the right, left, up and down to move the snake in the game.

## Objective of showing my project at Software Freedom Day

* Being able to create generic scripts that work for your different types of video games and that more people get moving, have fun, improve the experience of the game and above all generate significant progress in their health to have a superior quality of life.

* Also the idea is that it is an additional tool where your joystick is your body, and it is controlled by your movements. 

## Use cases in other countries

* A student with obesity problems in the United States refused to take the physical education course, but at school, seeing that he liked video games, they decided to alternate the class with Dance Dance Revolution (a game in which you must dance and believe me sweats) by the end of the year he had lost almost 20 kilos.

* Imagine being 80 years old, having been an excellent tennis player but due to physical conditions due to age, you can no longer practice ... it is a frustration that can turn into depression. Even Dr. Patch Adams mentions that smiling is the best medicine. Also my script can be part of the rehabilitation of many nursing homes.
